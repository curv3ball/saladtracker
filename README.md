<summary>FAQ</summary>
 
#### Is this safe to use?
- Yes, the script doesn't store your email or 2fa code, nor does it even have the capability to do so.<br>
Check the source or ask someone who knows about python to check it for you.

#### Is this allowed by Salad?
- Yes and no. This is more of a grey area as salad apparently has rules against apps that assist you with using salad<br>
but the apps targeted have all been able to give you some added functionality that salad didn't natively have, this does not do that.<br>
I have spoken to support members of the salad community, and this is what i was told: [Img1](https://i.imgur.com/Wgu1Apt.png) , [Img2](https://i.imgur.com/sGG9bOq.png)<br>
So you will not get in trouble for **using** this, but it is generally not allowed by their community.<br>
- **TDLR; It's safe to use and no one will even know you're using it, but it is **not** allowed**


#### Can I request a feature?
- Yes, you can request a feature by messaging me on discord, **@nypdk**
